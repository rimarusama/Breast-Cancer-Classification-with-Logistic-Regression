# Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression
This repository contains a Python script for building and evaluating a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using logistic regression. It uses the well-known Breast Cancer dataset provided by scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/sudammajhi/Breast-Cancer-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression.git
2. Nevigate to the project directory:
  cd breat-cancer-classification
3. Run the script:
  python Breast_Cancer_Prediction_using_LogisticsRegression.py

### Dataset
The Breast Cancer dataset used in this project is available through scikit-learn's dataset module. It consists of various features describing tumor characteristics and is used to predict the presence of malignant or benign tumors.

### Acknowledgments
1.The scikit-learn library for providing the Breast Cancer dataset.
2. Any additional acknowledgments or references you'd like to include.
Feel free to customize this README with more detailed information about your project, such as explanations of the code, results, and any additional resources or references. Good luck with your breast cancer classification project!
